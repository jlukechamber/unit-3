<h1>brooklyn trees</h1>
<p>New York City, with a population of over 8 million people, is also home to more than 5 million trees. As of 2020, New York City held 44,509 acres of urban tree canopy with 24% of its land covered in trees.
    In 1995 the city undertook an unprecendented effort to catalog every tree in the city - the first in what is now the decennial New York City tree census.
    We now have a better understanding than ever of this critical urban forest. You can find out more about the most recent tree census <a
    href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/treescount" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    The map and chart below display the tree density in Brooklyn neighborhoods of ten of the city's most common species. 
    <br>Go out and meet your local forest today!
